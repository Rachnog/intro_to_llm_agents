The event began on Aug. 27 and had been scheduled to end Monday, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the Black Rock Desert, where the festival was held.\\n “I’m not leaving until both ‘The Man’ and ‘The Temple’ burn,” Barger said, referring to the wooden effigy and wooden structure that are traditionally torched during the event’s last two nights.\\n London, the Southern California photographer who was attending his 20th Burning Man and just published a book on the festival, “Burning Man: Art On Fire,” spent much of Saturday walking barefoot across the site, which is about 5 square miles.'}, {'url': 'https://www.today.com/news/what-is-burning-man-flood-death-rcna103231', 'content': '\"\\nAn update on BurningMan.org posted the night of Sept. 3 offered those still on site a \"Wet Playa Survival Guide\" with tips, as well as an update saying that conditions were \"improving\" and that roads in Black Rock City were expected to open on Sept. 4 for \"Exodus.\"\\n\"Thank goodness this community knows how to take care of each other,\" the Instagram page for Burning Man Information Radio wrote on a post predicting more rain.\\nNeal Katyal, Chris Rock and others detail their ‘escape’ from Black Rock City\\nComedian Chris Rock and Diplo, producer and DJ,\\xa0were among this year\\'s Burning Man attendees.
